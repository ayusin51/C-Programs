<i>HTML</i> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is used to design Web Pages.<br>
Tags are used in HTML for designing the web pages.Tags are written on < > brackets.<br>
There are two types of tags : <u>Paired Tags and Singular Tags.</u><br>
Paired tags are those tags which require both <mark color="blue">starting and ending</mark>.The ending tag is also known as closing tag.
The closing is done by inserting a "/" in front of the tag. Example : HTML tag, Head tag ,Bold tag,<del>break tag</del> etc. <br>
Singular tags are those which need not to be closed. It is also known as stand alone tag. Example : Break tag, horizontal row tag, etc.<br>
