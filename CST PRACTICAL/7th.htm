    <center><h1>Definition of 'Hacking' </h1></center>
    <h3>Definition : </h3>
    <p>Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or 
	control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose.</p>
	<h2>Description : </h2>
	<p>To better describe hacking, one needs to first understand hackers. One can easily assume them to be intelligent and highly skilled in computers.
	In fact, breaking a security system requires more intelligence and expertise than actually creating one. There are no hard and fast rules whereby we can 
	categorize hackers into neat compartments. However, in general computer parlance, we call them white hats, black hats and grey hats. White hat professionals 
	hack to check their own security systems to make it more hack-proof. In most cases, they are part of the same organisation. Black hat hackers hack to take 
	control over the system for personal gains. They can destroy, steal or even prevent authorized users from accessing the system. They do this by finding 
	loopholes and weaknesses in the system. Some computer experts call them crackers instead of hackers. Grey hat hackers comprise curious people who have just 
	about enough computer language skills to enable them to hack a system to locate potential loopholes in the network security system. Grey hats differ from black
	hats in the sense that the former notify the admin of the network system about the weaknesses discovered in the system, whereas the latter is only looking for 
	personal gains. All kinds of hacking are considered illegal barring the work done by white hat hackers.<br> <br>
	<center><h1> Phone Hacking </h1></center>
	<p>Phone hacking is the practice of manipulating or gaining unauthorized access to mobile phones, such as by intercepting telephone calls or accessing 
	voicemail messages. When the unauthorized access is to the phone user's conversation, it is more commonly referred to as phone tapping.</p>
	<p>The term came to prominence during the News International phone hacking scandal, in which it was alleged (and in some cases proved in court) that the 
	British tabloid newspaper the News of the World had been involved in the interception of voicemail messages of the British Royal Family, other public figures, 
	and a murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.</p>
	<h2>Risks</h2>
	<p>Although many mobile phone users may be targeted, "for those who are famous, rich or powerful or whose prize is important enough (for whatever reason) to 
	devote time and resources to make a concerted attack, it is usually more common, there are real risks to face."</p>
	<h2><span id="Tech">Techniques</span></h2>
	<h3>VoiceMail Hacking </h3>
	<p>The unauthorised remote access to voicemail systems, such as exposed by the News International phone hacking scandal, is possible because of weaknesses in 
	the implementations of these systems by telcos.</p>
	<p>A weakness of some PABX systems lies in the distant voicemail feature, which is accessed by entering a password when the initial greeting is being played.
	A hacker can call a direct dial number with voicemail, and then try to use the default password or guess it, or then select the "call back" function, and 
	enter a premium rate number for the call back. The PABX calls back the premium rate line, confirming the password for the hacker. To stop this form of 
	hacking, it is important to turn off the call back feature on the PABX, or to use a strong password.</p>
	<p>Mobile phone companies usually allow access to associated voicemail messages using a landline telephone. This requires the entry of a Personal 
	Identification Number (PIN). Many mobile phone companies use a system that sets a well-known four digit default PIN that is rarely changed by the phone's 
	owner, making it easy for a hacker who knows both the phone number and the service provider to access the voicemail messages associated with that service.
	Even where the default PIN is not known, social engineering can be used to reset the voicemail PIN code to the default, by impersonating the owner of the 
	phone with a call to a call centre.Many people also use weak PINs that are easily guessable; to prevent subscribers from choosing PINs with weak 
	password strength, some mobile phone companies now disallow the use of consecutive or repeat digits in voicemail PIN codes.</p>
	<p>During the mid-2000s, it was discovered that calls emanating from the handset registered against a voicemail account were put straight through to 
	voicemail without needing to enter a PIN. A hacker could use caller ID spoofing to impersonate a victim's handset caller ID and thereby gain access to the 
	associated voicemail without a PIN.</p>
	<p>Following controversies over phone hacking and criticism that was levelled at mobile service providers who allowed access to voicemail without a PIN, 
	many mobile phone companies have strengthened the default security of their systems so that remote access to voicemail messages and other phone settings
	can no longer be achieved via a default PIN.[4] For example, AT&T announced in August 2011 that all new wireless subscribers would be required to enter a 
	PIN when checking their voicemail, even when checking it from their own phones, while T-Mobile stated that it "recommends that you turn on your voice mail
	password for added security, but as always, the choice is yours."</p>
	<h3>Handsets</h3>
	<p>An analysis of user-selected PIN codes suggested that ten numbers represent 15% of all iPhone passcodes, with "1234" and "0000" being the most common, 
	with years of birth and graduation also being common choices.[12] Even if a four-digit PIN is randomly selected, the key space is very small 
	making PINs significantly easier to brute force than most passwords; someone with physical access to a handset secured with a PIN can therefore feasibly 
	determine the PIN in a short time.</p>
	<p>Mobile phone microphones can be activated remotely by security agencies or telcos, without any need for physical access, as long as the battery has not 
	been removed.This "roving bug" feature has been used by law enforcement agencies and intelligence services to listen in on nearby conversations.</p>
	<p>Other techniques for phone hacking include tricking a mobile phone user into downloading malware which monitors activity on the phone. Bluesnarfing is 
	an unauthorized access to a phone via Bluetooth.</p>
